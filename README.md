# Car-detection-using-image-processing
Image processing project using Raspberry Pi, arduino and nrf24L01.

Once car is detected a message will be sent to the receiver.

The transmitter part comprises  of Raspberry  Pi and camera. The receiver part uses arduino. The commmunication between these is done using wireless transreceiver nrf24l01.
